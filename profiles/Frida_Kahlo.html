						Described as “the most famous female artist in history” by Tate Modern, Frida Kahlo’s rise to full international icon occurred a half-century after her death. 
            Kahlo represents values such as “empowerment”, “freedom”, “independence”, “honesty” and “being true to yourself”. With a major feature film based on a best-selling 
            book of her life, a record-breaking $5.6m (£3.7m) sale for a work of Latin American art, and devotees from Madonna to Isabella Rossellini, Kahlohas become a          
            21st-century cultural icon. Yet at her death in 1954, she was hardly known outside her native Mexico. Her rising importance over the past three decades is perhaps  
            due to fascination with her personal life, and the intimate way in which she documented its challenges as a woman and an artist.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Born in 1907 in Coyoacán, Kahlo was a marginalised voice for many reasons: she was a woman, an invalid after polio during childhood left her with a damaged leg, 
            the child of migrant and indigenous ancestry (her mother was a devout Catholic of Spanish-indigenous descent, her father a German-Hungarian immigrant) – 
            and it was from these limitations that she somehow found the freedom to break every rule and be true to herself.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The early years of her marriage to the preeminent muralist and painter Diego Rivera were marked by multiple miscarriages, which she documented with an honesty that
            is astonishing even today.Diego Rivera described his wife as “the first woman in the history of art to treat, with absolute and uncompromising honesty, one might 
            even say impassive cruelty, those general and specific themes which exclusively affect women”. Perhaps it is because Kahlo’s work peels back the deepest layers of  
            her being, expressing her self-discovery in such a direct and visceral way, that her message appears universal to a modern society that is obsessed with self-disclosure.
