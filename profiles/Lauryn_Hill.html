						 Lauryn Noelle Hill was born on May 26, 1975, in East Orange, New Jersey. Hill has said of her musically oriented family: "there were so many records, so much music constantly being played. My mother played piano, my father sang, and we were always surrounded in music."
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						In 1988, Hill appeared as an Amateur Night contestant on It's Showtime at the Apollo. She sang her own version of the Smokey Robinson track "Who's Lovin' You?", garnering an initially harsh reaction from the crowd. Despite many artists being successful at the Apollo Showtime and getting their starts in their careers there.

						While a freshman in high school, through mutual friends, Prakazrel "Pras" Michel approached Hill about a music group he was creating. Hill and Pras began under the name Tranzlator Crew, chosen because they wanted to rhyme in different languages. Another female vocalist was soon replaced by Michel's cousin, multi-instrumentalist Wyclef Jean.
					</p>

						Hill took acting lessons in Manhattan while growing up. She began her acting career in 1991, appearing with Jean in Club XII, MC Lyte's Off-Broadway hip-hop rendering of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. While the play was not a success, an agent noticed her and she went on to star in films like Sister Act 2. In 1996 Lauryn Hill, as a member of The Fugees went on to record The Score album and sell millions.
					</p>
					<br>

						Hill recorded her solo record The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill from late 1997 through June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Jamaica. Songs such as "To Zion" spoke about her decision to have her first baby, even though many at the time encouraged her to have an abortion so to not interfere with her blossoming career. But in fact, Hill's pregnancy revived her from a period of writer's block.
					</p>
					<br>

						Released on August 25, 1998, the album received rave reviews from contemporary music critics, and was the most acclaimed album of 1998. topped the Billboard 200 for four weeks and the Billboard R&B Albums chart for six weeks. It went on to sell about 8 million copies in the U.S. and 12 million copies worldwide.
