  Before she became a media mogul and the queen of daytime TV, Winfrey suffered a tumultuous childhood. She was shuffled between family members, spending her first few years on her grandmother's farm in Mississippi. When her grandmother fell ill, 6-year-old Winfrey was sent to live with her mother, where she grew up around extreme poverty, and endured years of sexual and physical abuse. At age 14, Winfrey broke free and went to live with her dad in Nashville, Tennessee, where her success would start to take course.

At high school, she discovered her passion for media, joining the speech team and working for a local black radio station after school. By her senior year she had secured a full scholarship to Tennessee State University. She left college early to become the first black female news anchor in Nashville, starting as a local anchor before landing a co-anchor position in Baltimore. She was sexually harassed and humiliated at her job in Baltimore and was even fired seven and a half months after joining.

She went on to host the then-stagnant morning talk show, "AM Chicago" which Winfrey turned from the lowest-rated talk show in Chicago to the highest. Three years later the show was renamed "The Oprah Winfrey Show” and brought in $300 million a year during its peak. Winfrey has also been involved in films, television series, and plays. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the 1985 drama "The Color Purple." She has also published her own magazine, started a radio channel and most recently launched a cable channel, the Oprah Winfrey Network.

Now in her 60s, Winfrey has a lifestyle that she could only have dreamed of during her traumatic childhood. The Oprah Winfrey Show has earned her widespread popularity, as well as her own production company. Today, Forbes estimates Winfrey's net worth at $3 billion, and she is the only black woman on the publication's list of the 400 richest people in America.
